                <p class="copy">Whether you eat pumpkin or sweet potato pie for Thanksgiving, one thing nearly everyone can agree on is that holidays get heated.</p>
                <p class="copy">While this time of year brings families together around the dinner table, that table is often more of a battleground as sibling rivalries, annoying habits and ideological differences rear their heads in blowouts of epic proportions.</p>
                <p class="copy">In interviews in midtown on Tuesday, New Yorkers shared what they anticipate will be the most controversial topics at their dinner tables this holiday season.</p>
                <p class="copy">“Politics. Definitely politics,” said Daniel Coles, 56, of Long Island, who was enjoying a drink in Bryant Park with his wife, Michelle.</p>
                <p class="copy">“Probably Trump, or my lack of a job,” said Kellie Tice, 35, who is traveling to Florida for the weekend to spend the holiday with her girlfriend’s grandparents.</p>
                <p class="copy">Jaclyn Lovell, 38 and a teacher at The New School, always braces for a bumpy ride when she goes home to Wisconsin for the holidays.</p>
                <p class="copy">“Last Christmas my dad used the n-word,” said Lovell, cringing as she described the first time she brought her boyfriend, who is black, home for the holidays. </p>
                <p class="copy">Lovell said her family worked through the race issues, but the drama always finds a new target.</p>
                <p class="copy">“My guess is my mom is going to say some very controversial things about my grandma slowing down that’s going to upset everyone,” said Lovell.</p>
                <p class="copy">For some families, the debate is more benign. </p>
                <p class="copy">Edd Newell, a UPS deliveryman from Brooklyn said the biggest argument in his family will be, “Where’s the cornbread? Who’s hogging the food?”</p>
                <p class="copy">For Dina Lerman, 55, and Gerd Stoeckel, 56, holiday drama is a non-issue. The couple sells their children’s clothing line at a pop-up shop in Bryant Park and will be working straight through the holidays.</p>
                <p class="copy">“We literally are not going to be having family time until January,” said Lerman.</p>
                <p class="copy">And maybe that’s the answer. In an <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3372291/Families-fight-Christmas-hypercopresence.html">interview with the Daily Mail</a>, University of West Virginia Communications Professor Melanie Booth-Butterfield attributes this holiday tension to a condition known as “hyper-copresence.” Simply put, suddenly spending 24 hours a day with people you rarely see, often in cramped quarters, sends people over the edge. Especially if they already disagree on politics.</p>
                <p class="copy">Maybe having to work over Thanksgiving isn’t so bad. Then again, it just won’t be the holidays without one good row.</p>
